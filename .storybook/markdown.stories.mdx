The Storybook design system codifies existing UI components into a central, well-maintained repository. It is built to address having to paste the same components into multiple projects again and again. This simplifies building UI's with Storybook's design patterns.

SDS was created by Kyle Suss, Dominic Nguyen (me!), and Michael Shilman with invaluable accessibility contributions from Jimmy Somsanith.
